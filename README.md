### 1. Project Title

**Optimizing Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions Using Machine Learning**

### 2. Executive Summary

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this project is to identify the most effective machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, thereby maximizing financial savings and minimizing the occurrence of fraud.

**Context:**  
This analysis utilized synthetic credit card transaction data, mimicking real-world data. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and its associated libraries, including LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks.

### 3. Business Problem

**Problem Identification:**  
The challenge was to detect fraudulent transactions from a large dataset of credit card transactions. Fraudulent activities lead to significant financial losses and customer dissatisfaction.

**Business Impact:**  
Effective fraud detection enhances financial security, reduces financial losses, and improves customer trust and satisfaction. By accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, the business can save substantial amounts of money.

### 4. Methodology

**Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
- Removal of irrelevant transaction types and unusually large transaction amounts.
- Imputation of missing values in merchant number, merchant state, and merchant zip using dictionaries and manual inputs.
- Generation of new variables such as degree centrality, frequency and amount metrics, and velocity change variables.

**Analysis Techniques:**  
- Feature selection using stepwise selection combined with LightGBM and Random Forest models.
- Model exploration using logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks.
- Evaluation of model performance on training, testing, and out-of-time validation datasets.

### 5. Skills

**Tools, Languages, & Software:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** LightGBM, CatBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Software:** Jupyter Notebook

### 6. Results & Business Recommendation

**Business Impact:**  
The LightGBM model demonstrated superior performance in detecting fraudulent transactions, with a fraud detection rate (FDR) cut off at 3%. This model provided a maximum potential savings of $21,288,000.

**Insights:**
- **Feature Importance:** Variables related to transaction frequency, amount, and merchant details were critical in predicting fraud.
- **Model Performance:** LightGBM outperformed other models with a wrapper performance score of 0.72 and demonstrated no overfitting.
- **Visualization:** Key insights were visualized through performance plots, financial impact plots, and distribution summaries of transaction attributes.

### 7. Next Steps

**Future Work:**
- Further refinement of the feature engineering process to include more sophisticated network analysis metrics.
- Exploration of additional machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to enhance detection accuracy.
- Implementation of real-time fraud detection systems using the chosen model for immediate action on suspected fraudulent transactions.

By following these steps, the project effectively addressed the business problem, delivering actionable insights and substantial financial benefits.
